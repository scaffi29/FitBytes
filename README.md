# FitBytes
Fall 2016 Capstone Project Team #6

This project is an Android application about meal planning with aspects of fitness elements like goal creation and tracking.

This app will let you plan meals with user created recipes. Users will have a pantry where they have a inventory of ingredients used in the recipes of various meals. When a meal is created it will use a recipe and subtract the required ingredients from the pantry. A date will be set on when the meal is planned. The user can also set goals for themselves to complete like steps walked or ride a bike for 30 minutes a day. Users can even use a barcode scanner to add ingredients into their pantry and retrieve nutritional facts for that item from the USDA database.
